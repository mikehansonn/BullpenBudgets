For each team hold last 5 gamedays, along with the date

Each player will have pitches thrown in each of those 5 games

Along with that each player will have total from last 3/7/14 days (Not gamedays, just total days)
The data for each player will be stored in a txt for each team where each amount of pitches is stored with the ordinal date.

Use this to get current ordinal date for checking dates
# Get current date
current_date = datetime.now()
# Convert to ordinal date
current_ordinal_date = current_date.toordinal()


Sequence:
+ Request Webpage             ----> new data is now formated into [team, [pitcher, pitches], ...]
Read Pitchers from json     ----> read old data into league object
                                    > league
                                        > teams
                                            > players
                                                > player.name, player.all_outings
Write new player to team    ----> if there is a new player that is not on the team, make him a player object
Write new data to players   ----> if the player already exists, write his new outing to his player object
once new data is written write all teams back to file    
                                    
The json format will be  a new player on each line
[name, [pitches, date], [pitches, date]]


things to add right now
- if the player started to game and is not already included in the current json file
  do read in this new data. Doing this, we will make sure to take spot bullpen starts
  while ensuring that we are not reading in starters into BULLPEN budgets.


Data that I currently have and plans
  - Currently we have the ability to get all the pitch counts from a current day 
    and append that data to a file that contains all the pitchers from that group.
  - Still need to implement the counting of past 3, 7, 14 days for a pitcher
  - Along with that check to total bullpen health of a team
    - This total health will take into account ...
        - Total bullpen options
        - Total pitches thrown over last 3, 7, and 14 days
        - Pitchers that have thrown in games in either of the past 2 days
            - if both, there is an increased penalty 
        - Each outing should be 20 pitches
            - Anything under will be a reward to the grade
            - Anything over 20 pitches will be a penalty
